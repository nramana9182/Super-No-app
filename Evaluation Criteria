1. Pipeline Efficiency
Implementation:
Ensure the CI/CD pipeline is automated, error-free, and modular:
Use caching for dependencies to improve build times actions/cache in GitHub Actions or equivalent in Jenkins.
Automate builds, tests, and deployments for backend and frontend using YAML configuration files.
Use parallel jobs for independent tasks to optimize runtime.

Example Checkpoints:
Pipelines trigger on every push/PR.
Error handling implemented in scripts e.g., fallback to previous states if deployment fails.
Pipeline completion time does not exceed acceptable limits10 minutes for typical builds.

Evaluation Metrics:
Time to complete the build.
Success rate of pipeline runs.
Test coverage percentage in CI.

2. Infrastructure Design
Implementation:
Use IaC tools  Terraform for scalable, secure, and maintainable infrastructure
Modularize Terraform code using reusable modules for VPC, EC2, RDS, etc.
Implement proper security groups for database and API endpoints (e.g., only whitelisted IPs or private subnets).
Auto-scale infrastructure to handle dynamic loads.

Example Checkpoints:
Infrastructure scripts successfully provision environments (development, staging, production) with isolated resources.
Scripts handle edge cases like resource contention or invalid configurations.

Evaluation Metrics:
Scalability and load-handling capability.
Security measures implemented ( encrypted traffic, restricted access.
Ease of adding/removing resources through scripts.

3. Monitoring Effectiveness
Implementation:
Integrate monitoring and logging tools  Prometheus, Grafana, ELK
Create dashboards for metrics like CPU usage, memory utilization, response time, and error rates.
Set up alerts for critical issues  downtime, high error rates, disk space utilization.

Example Checkpoints:
Prometheus collects metrics from Kubernetes pods and applications.
Grafana dashboards provide actionable insights and trends.
Centralized logging Fluentd + Elasticsearch + Kibana provides searchable logs for debugging.

Evaluation Metrics:
Number of critical metrics being monitored.
Alert responsiveness and resolution time.
Completeness and clarity of logs in the logging system.

4. Code Quality
Implementation:
Structure Terraform, Docker, and pipeline scripts for readability.
Add comments and documentation for every script to explain its purpose and usage.
Perform static code analysis using tools like SonarQube to check for vulnerabilities and code smells.
